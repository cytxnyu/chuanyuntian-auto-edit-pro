# Blocking visual quality gates

These checks apply to every real invocation. Passing unit tests, typecheck, build, or render is not visual acceptance.

## 1. Intentional whole-screen presentation

Judge the composition, not whether it protects a fixed center lane. Large foreground graphics, translucent face overlap, opaque full-screen, a clear presenter surrounded by graphics, and front/behind crossings are permitted. A beat can move between these states. Preserve established component aesthetics; do not mechanically cycle treatments.

Record the purpose and reveal timing of coverage. Real gesture interaction uses observed source frames. Behind-subject effects use aligned transparent person frames; inspect matte edges and depth-order transitions. A merely translucent source duplicate does not pass as depth interaction.

## 2. Content-fit at any scale

There is no fixed maximum card height or side-only rule. Keep headings, items and takeaways readable and intentionally related; remove decorative empty regions. Big components can cross the center or leave the frame during motion, but their intended reading state must be legible. Preserve established palettes and component identities.

## 3. Subtitle / keyword handoff

Brief coverage is permitted when an explicit time window and readable keyword phrase carry the same spoken meaning. Check entry, end and restoration; do not introduce a duplicate caption track. Outside handoffs, covered captions need a readable continuation or the original caption area must become visible again. A full-screen beat is not automatically opaque: transparency is a creative choice, not a failure.

## 4. Stable review frames

Representative stills are selected at 72% of each beat, after the main entry animation but before the exit. A midpoint screenshot is not sufficient because it can capture a half-built layout.

Gate C must include:

1. eight frames from eight distinct semantic structures when the video semantics support them;
2. the exact timestamp, structure, presentation mode, and SHA-256 for every frame;
3. a 4×2 contact sheet built from those exact frames;
4. inspect stage interaction entry, contact, depth switch and exit frames in addition to stable frames; review a short motion excerpt for these interactions;
5. manual frame review, recorded as pass/fail for intentional occlusion, observed gesture alignment, matte edges, density, clipping, contrast, semantic fit, and subtitle/keyword continuity.

## 5. Blocking decision

Any of the following blocks Gate D:

- an accidental overlap prevents the intended meaning from being read;
- a promised contact/depth action has visibly incorrect alignment, matte edges or ordering;
- a covered subtitle has no readable keyword/caption handoff;
- side card visibly padded with unused space;
- content clipped, overlapping, or too small to read;
- screenshot captured before the composition reaches a stable readable state;
- structure selected for visual variety rather than spoken meaning;
- evidence treated as decoration or an illustration treated as proof;
- any manual review item left unchecked.

After fixes, regenerate the real screenshots and review the new images. Do not reuse screenshots from a rejected render.
